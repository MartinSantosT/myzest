## Why Zest?

Every recipe manager out there treats food like data: title, ingredients, steps, done. But cooking is more than that. It's the Sunday your daughter helped you make pasta for the first time. The improvised dinner that became a family legend. The photo your partner took while you weren't looking.

**Zest is a culinary diary** — recipes + memories + beautiful shareable cards, all running on your own hardware in a single container. No cloud, no subscriptions, no telemetry. Just your food story, owned by you.

### What makes it different

- **Memories** — Attach photos, dates, locations, and stories to any recipe. Build a timeline of your cooking life.
- **Moment Cards** — Generate gorgeous shareable images (Instagram Stories, square, landscape) from your memories with one click.
- **Cookbooks** — Curate collections and share them via public links or export as beautiful PDFs.
- **"What to Cook?"** — Tell Zest what ingredients you have, it tells you what you can make.
- **4-Tier Recipe Scraper** — Paste any URL. Zest tries recipe-scrapers, JSON-LD, Microdata, then HTML heuristics. It *will* find the recipe.
- **Stupid simple to run** — One `docker compose up`. SQLite. No Postgres, no Redis, no external services.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MartinSantosT/myzest.git
cd zest
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** and that's it. First-time setup takes about 30 seconds.

**First launch:** Register your account — the first user becomes admin and gets 12 example recipes with photos to explore.

### Generate a secure secret key

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Paste the result in your `.env` file:

```env
ZEST_SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-here
```

**Stack:** FastAPI · SQLAlchemy · SQLite · Pillow · ReportLab · Vanilla JS (ES Modules) · Tailwind CSS

No frontend build step. No webpack. No node_modules. The frontend is a single HTML file with 26 ES modules loaded natively by the browser.

---

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ZEST_SECRET_KEY` | `zest-change-this-secret-in-production` | JWT signing key. **Change this.** |

### Volumes

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `./data:/app/data` | Database, backups, exports |
| `./app:/app/app` | Application code (enables hot reload in dev) |

### Ports

Default port is `8000`. Change it in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "3000:8000"  # Access on port 3000
```

---

## Updating

```bash
cd zest
git pull
docker compose build
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

Zest handles database migrations automatically on startup.

---

## Backups

Zest includes a built-in backup system accessible from **Settings → Backups**:

- **Automatic backups** — Configure frequency (12h / 24h / 7 days) and retention count
- **Manual backups** — One-click database + images export as `.zip`
- **Import/Export** — Move your data between instances or restore from backup
- **JSON export** — Export recipes as portable JSON for interoperability

Backups are stored in `./data/backups/` on the host.

---

## Running tests

```bash
docker exec zest_backend pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## Reverse proxy (optional)

Example Nginx config for exposing Zest with HTTPS:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name zest.example.com;  # e.g. myzest.app

    ssl_certificate     /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    client_max_body_size 20M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Works great behind **Caddy**, **Traefik**, or **Nginx Proxy Manager** too.

## Health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# {"status": "healthy", "recipes": 42, "users": 1}
```

Perfect for **Uptime Kuma**, **Healthchecks.io**, or any monitoring tool.

## Tech details for the curious

- **Recipe scraping** uses a 4-tier fallback: `recipe-scrapers` library (400+ sites) → JSON-LD structured data → Microdata attributes → CSS heuristic selectors. If a recipe exists on the page, Zest will find it.
- **Moment Cards** are generated server-side with Pillow. No external APIs, no Canvas tricks. Pure Python image generation with gradient overlays, typography, and branding.
- **PDF export** uses ReportLab with DejaVu fonts (bundled in the Docker image) for proper Unicode support.
- **Auth** uses bcrypt with automatic legacy hash migration. Rate limiting via slowapi on sensitive endpoints.
- **Frontend** is a true SPA built with vanilla JavaScript ES modules. Zero dependencies. Zero build tools. Fast.
- **Image processing** automatically resizes uploads to max 1920px, converts HEIC to JPEG, and preserves EXIF metadata.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Cooking mode (full-screen step-by-step with auto-detected timers and Wake Lock)
- [ ] Meal planner with drag-and-drop weekly view
- [ ] Multi-user family accounts
- [ ] PWA with offline support
- [ ] AI recipe import from video (Whisper + LLM)
