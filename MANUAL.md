## 1. Installation

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- About 200 MB of disk space (image + dependencies)
- Any hardware: Raspberry Pi 4, NAS, old laptop, cloud VM — anything that runs Docker

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zest.git
cd zest
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser. That's it.

### Secure Your Instance

1. **Change the secret key** — Open `.env` and replace the default value:

```bash
# Generate a secure key:
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Paste the result as `ZEST_SECRET_KEY` in your `.env` file, then restart:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

2. **Change the default password** — Log in with `admin@zest.local` / `admin`, then go to **Settings → Profile** and update your password immediately.

### Custom Port

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to change the port:

```yaml
ports:
  - "3000:8000"   # Access Zest on port 3000
```

### Reverse Proxy

If you're exposing Zest to your local network or the internet, place it behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik, or Nginx Proxy Manager). See the README for an example Nginx configuration.

---

## 2. First Steps

When you first log in, Zest shows a brief onboarding experience:

1. **Welcome** — Introduction to Zest's philosophy
2. **Your recipes, your story** — How to create or import your first recipe
3. **Memories** — What makes Zest different: connecting photos and moments to recipes

You can skip the onboarding at any time, or click **"Create my first memory"** to jump right in.

### The Dashboard

After onboarding, you'll see the main dashboard with:

- **Recipe grid** — All your recipes displayed as cards with photos, ratings, and time estimates
- **Sidebar** (left) — Navigation between Recipes, What to Cook, Shopping List, Cookbooks, Memories, and Settings
- **Search bar** — Filter recipes by text, category, tag, or rating
- **+ New Recipe** button — Create a new recipe from scratch

---

## 3. Recipes

### Creating a Recipe

1. Click **+ New Recipe** (or the orange button in the top right)
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Description** — A short intro or story about the dish
   - **Prep Time & Cook Time** — In minutes
   - **Servings** — How many portions the recipe makes
   - **Photo** — Click the image area to upload a hero photo. You can add up to 4 photos total (1 hero + 3 additional)
3. **Ingredients** — Add one per row. Each ingredient has structured fields:
   - Quantity (number)
   - Unit (cups, grams, tbsp, etc.)
   - Name (the ingredient itself)
   - Note (optional: "finely chopped", "room temperature")
4. **Steps** — Add preparation steps in order. Drag to reorder if needed.
5. **Categories & Tags** — Assign categories and color-coded tags (see section 4)
6. Click **Save**

### Editing a Recipe

Click any recipe card to open its detail view, then click the **Edit** (pencil) button. All fields are editable. Changes are saved when you click **Save**.

### Deleting a Recipe

In the recipe detail view, click **Delete** (trash icon). You'll be asked to confirm. Deletion removes the recipe, its ingredients, steps, images, and any associated cookbook entries. Linked memories are preserved but their recipe association is removed.

### Rating & Favorites

- **Rating** — Click the stars (1–5) on any recipe card or in the detail view
- **Favorites** — Click the heart icon to toggle a recipe as favorite. Use the sidebar filter to view only favorites.

### Multi-Photo Support

Each recipe supports up to 4 photos: one hero image (displayed on the card) and 3 additional photos visible in the detail view. Click the "+" area below the hero image to add more photos.

---

## 4. Categories & Tags

### Categories

Categories are broad classifications for your recipes (e.g., "Mexican", "Desserts", "Soups", "Quick Meals").

- **Adding categories** — In the recipe modal, type in the category field. If it doesn't exist, Zest creates it automatically.
- **Autocomplete** — As you type, matching categories appear as suggestions.
- **Managing categories** — Go to **Settings → Categories** to rename or delete categories.
- A recipe can belong to multiple categories.

### Tags

Tags are flexible, color-coded labels for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., "Spicy", "Kid-friendly", "Date night", "Meal prep").

- **Adding tags** — In the recipe modal, select existing tags or create new ones.
- **Custom colors** — Each tag has a color. Click the color swatch to change it.
- **Filtering** — Click any tag in the sidebar or recipe grid to filter by that tag. Multiple filters can be combined.

---

## 5. Importing Recipes from URLs

Zest includes a powerful 4-tier scraping engine that can extract recipes from virtually any cooking website.

### How to Import

1. Click the **"Import from URL"** option in the sidebar
2. Paste the URL of the recipe page
3. Click **Scrape**
4. Zest shows a preview with the extracted data: title, description, ingredients, steps, times, servings, and photo
5. Review and edit anything before saving
6. Click **Save** to add it to your collection

### How the Scraper Works

Zest tries four methods in order, using the first one that succeeds:

1. **recipe-scrapers** library — Supports 400+ popular cooking sites with site-specific parsers
2. **JSON-LD** — Reads structured data embedded in the page (Schema.org Recipe format)
3. **Microdata** — Reads HTML microdata attributes
4. **Heuristic analysis** — Intelligent CSS selector matching for unstructured pages

Imported recipes are automatically tagged with the "Imported from Internet" category and a blue badge showing the source domain.

---

## 6. Ingredients & Portion Calculator

### Structured Ingredients

Each ingredient has four fields:

- **Quantity** — A number (supports decimals: 0.5, 1.25, etc.)
- **Unit** — The measurement (cups, grams, ml, tbsp, tsp, oz, lb, etc.)
- **Name** — The ingredient name
- **Note** — Optional details ("diced", "at room temperature", "optional")

### Portion Calculator

On any recipe detail view:

1. Look for the **servings** indicator (e.g., "Serves 4")
2. Use the **+** and **−** buttons to adjust the number of servings
3. All ingredient quantities recalculate proportionally in real-time
4. Fractions are displayed beautifully: ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅔, ¾

For example, a recipe for 4 servings with "2 cups of flour" scaled to 6 servings shows "3 cups of flour".

---

## 7. What to Cook?

This is one of Zest's unique features. It answers the question: "I have chicken, rice, and onion — what can I make?"

### How to Use

1. Click **"What to Cook?"** in the sidebar
2. Start typing an ingredient name — suggestions appear from your recipe database
3. Click to add ingredients to your list
4. Zest instantly shows matching recipes, ranked by match percentage

### Understanding the Results

Each result shows:

- **Match percentage** — How many of the recipe's ingredients you have (green = 75%+, orange = 50%+, gray = below 50%)
- **Missing ingredients** — Highlighted in red so you know what you'd need to buy
- **Portion adjustment** — Scale the recipe right from the results
- **"Add to Shopping List"** — One click to add the missing ingredients to your shopping list

---

## 8. Shopping List

### Adding Items

There are several ways to add items to your shopping list:

- From any recipe detail view, click **"Add to Shopping List"**
- From the "What to Cook?" results, click **"Add missing items"**
- Manually type items in the shopping list view

### Smart Combining

When you add ingredients from multiple recipes, Zest combines them intelligently. If Recipe A needs 200g rice and Recipe B needs 100g rice, your shopping list shows 300g rice.

### Using the List

- Check off items as you shop
- The list persists between sessions
- Clear completed items or the entire list when done

---

## 9. Memories

Memories are what makes Zest different from every other recipe manager. A Memory connects photos, dates, locations, and stories to a recipe — turning your recipe collection into a culinary diary.

### Creating a Memory

1. Click **Memories** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ New Memory**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Title** — "Christmas dinner 2025", "First attempt at sourdough", etc.
   - **Photos** — Upload up to 10 photos. JPEG photos with EXIF data will auto-fill the date and location.
   - **Date** — When it happened (auto-detected from photo EXIF if available)
   - **Location** — Where it happened (auto-detected from GPS coordinates via reverse geocoding)
   - **Story** — The description of what happened, who was there, why it was special
   - **Linked Recipe** — Associate this memory with a recipe from your collection
4. Click **Save**

### Photo Features

- **Multi-photo upload** — Select multiple photos at once
- **EXIF auto-detection** — Zest reads the date and GPS coordinates from JPEG photos automatically
- **Reverse geocoding** — GPS coordinates are converted to readable place names (e.g., "Brooklyn, New York")
- **HEIC/HEIF support** — iPhone photos work out of the box
- **Image optimization** — Photos are automatically resized (max 1920px) and converted to JPEG for optimal storage

### Viewing Memories

- **Grid view** — All memories displayed as cards with cover photo, date, location, and linked recipe
- **Detail view** — Click any memory to see the full photo gallery, story, and metadata
- **From recipe view** — Each recipe shows its associated memories in a dedicated section

### Editing & Deleting

- Click the **Edit** button in the memory detail view to modify any field or add/remove photos
- Click **Delete** to permanently remove the memory and its photos

---

   - **Square** (1080×1080) — Instagram feed, WhatsApp
   - **Landscape** (1200×630) — Facebook, Twitter/X
4. Preview updates in real-time
5. Click **Download** or use the **Share** button (on mobile, uses the native share sheet)

### Card Design

   - **Frequency** — Every 12 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days
   - **Retention** — How many backups to keep (default: 7)
   - **Include images** — Whether to include uploaded photos in backups

Backups are stored in the `./data/backups/` directory on your host machine.

### Manual Export

- **JSON export** — Exports recipes in a portable JSON format for interoperability.

### Import

- **Database import** — Upload a full backup ZIP to restore your entire instance. Warning: this replaces the current database completely.
- **JSON import** — Upload a JSON file to add recipes to your existing collection. Duplicates are detected and skipped.

### Migration Between Servers

1. Export a full backup from the old server
2. Set up a fresh Zest instance on the new server
3. Import the backup
4. Done — all recipes, memories, cookbooks, and images are restored

---

## 18. Troubleshooting

### "Port 8000 is already in use"

Change the port in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "9000:8000"
```

On Windows, ports 7681–8782 may be blocked by Hyper-V. Use port 9000 or higher.

### Photos won't upload

- Check that the `./app/static/uploads` directory exists and is writable
- Maximum file size depends on your reverse proxy configuration. Add `client_max_body_size 20M;` to your Nginx config.

### Database migration errors

Run the migration script manually:

```bash
docker exec zest_backend python migrate.py
```

The script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times) and creates a backup before making changes.

### HEIC photos not working

HEIC support requires the `pillow-heif` package, which is included in the default Docker image. If you're running Zest outside Docker, install it separately:

```bash
pip install pillow-heif
```

### Forgot your password

If you're locked out, you can reset via the database:

```bash
docker exec -it zest_backend python -c "
import bcrypt
from app.database import SessionLocal
from app.models import User
db = SessionLocal()
user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == 'your@email.com').first()
user.password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(b'newpassword', bcrypt.gensalt()).decode()
db.commit()
print('Password reset successfully')
"
```

### Health Check

Verify your instance is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# {"status": "healthy", "recipes": 42, "users": 1}
```

Use this endpoint with Uptime Kuma, Healthchecks.io, or any monitoring tool.
